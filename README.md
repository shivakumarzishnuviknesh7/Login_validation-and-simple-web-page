This project is a single-page web application that serves as a login portal. It consists of a login form where users can enter their username and password. When the correct credentials are entered, the page transitions to a welcome message, indicating a successful login. The transition between the login page and the welcome page happens dynamically within the same page without needing to reload the entire page.
